With the use of classes, it is easy to identify what the object is. The main goal of the project is to sort out all the different types of objects and classification it by using machine learning algorithm. It consists of the input layer, hidden layer and the output layer. With the help of this, we get the desired output. On comparing it with the actual output, accuracy is achieved.

Nowadays there is a major emphasis on extracting information from images. So, some pre-processing enhancement on the image is required which eliminates the noise and prepares the image useful for particular application. In this project work Object recognition and counting number of object of particular class are the main objectives. In the first phase study of different methodologies for recognising the objects of use is done. Various object detection techniques such as morphological operations and Image Segmentation techniques are studied for object recognition.  In this project work, in phase I, identifying and extracting of the objects is done. Further these objects will be classified in the classes of interest in phase II.  This is performed by using the concepts of Back Propagation Machine Learning Algorithm. \r\nImage classification is an important problem for classifying objects of the image under consideration.
